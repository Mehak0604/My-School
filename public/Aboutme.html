    <h1>Who Are We</h1>
    <p>The school was established in the year 1987 with a mission to provide quality education ensuring at the same time, overall development of the child. Due to the limitation of space at Civil Lines, the management took a decision to acquire land near Koradi for expanding the activities of the school.</p>
    <p>A sprawling campus came into being at Koradi with all the requisite facilities in terms of space, laboratories, playground etc. The schoolâ€™s strength grew considerably with the addition of many sections, and unmatched transport facilities from almost all parts of the city. With the dedicated and untiring efforts of the teachers, the school has recorded 100% result for the past 12 years. The children are encouraged and motivated to do their best both in curricular and the extracurricular activities. By establishing a good rapport with parents and working on the feedback provided, the interests of the students are well taken care of in spite of the phenomenal success achieved during the past decade. We at Modern School would like to put in lot more efforts to expand the activities and ensure quality education to the children. In this context, in addition to the existing subject the school has added Engineering Drawing as an elective subject, to std. XI in the session 2002, and it is adding Engineering Graphics, Physical Education, and Informatics Practices so as to keep pace with the present day requirements. School has also introduced commerce stream from the session 2011-12.</p>
    <p>Apart from providing quality education, the school believes in value system, the value that elders instill in youngsters as practiced in the ancient time in gurukula system.</p>
